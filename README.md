## How to use (will add pictures later):

### Click the "Login with Spotify" button to create your own Bingo Card of your top artists. You will be prompted to give us permission to access your top songs and your Spotify profile information.
### If it's your first time using our app, it will prompt you to create a Bingofy card. Click the "Create Card" button.
### That will generate a Bingofy card for you. The placement of artists on your Bingofy card will be shuffled for people filling it out.
### Click the "Share" button at the top of the screen or the link itself to copy it to your clipboard.
### Right-click (or press and hold if on mobile) the "Share" button or the link itself to change the invite code at the end of the link. Since invite codes have to be unique to your own Bingofy card, you might not be able to use an invite code if it has already been taken.
### Send your Bingofy invite link to your friends for them to fill it out!
